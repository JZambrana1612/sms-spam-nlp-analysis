-- Example: Find top 10 most common words in spam messages (requires pre-tokenized data or advanced text parsing)
-- If MySQL 8+ is used, you could use CTEs or JSON table processing. For now, this is a placeholder comment.
-- You may need to preprocess keywords in Python or tokenize into a separate table.
-- Alternatively, export spam messages only for NLP-based keyword analysis.

-- Suggested: Extract and load keywords into a table `spam_keywords` with columns (keyword, frequency)

-- SELECT keyword, COUNT(*) AS frequency
-- FROM spam_keywords
-- GROUP BY keyword
-- ORDER BY frequency DESC
-- LIMIT 10;

-- Placeholder:
SELECT 'Use Python to extract top keywords from spam messages' AS note;
